Dude, just finished watching Last Breath. Man, what a ride! I swear, I’m still trying to catch mine, lol. It’s like, you know, when your whole life flashes before your eyes, only you’re living someone else's. That poor diver, seriously, I was gripping the edge of my seat like I was holding onto dear life myself. 

I mean, who even lets themselves get into that kind of mess at the bottom of the North Sea? And the fact that they actually had cameras there to capture all this... I don't even get it. It felt like an episode of What Not to Do Underwater, if that was a thing. You ever feel like everything’s going to hell but you kinda can't look away? Yep, that’s exactly it.

> And the crew! Like, how do these guys even function down there without freaking out every minute? The one dude had to watch his mate slowly run out of air, and he just... did it. Like, okay, no biggie, just another Tuesday. You can forget me diving past the shallow end of the pool after seeing that, no way.

Hey, ever wonder how they manage to come back topside and just go get a pint like it’s all normal? I'd probs need a week to just download the movie of my sanity back from the cloud, if you catch my drift. “Oh hey honey, nearly witnessed my buddy become fish food today, wanna order pizza?

Honestly, makes my job as a bus driver feel like a breeze. Just dealing with a few crazies onboard is nothing compared to, what, potential death at sea every day? Plus, I get to watch the world pass by from my little mobile kingdom. At least I know buses won’t ever run out of air anytime soon... hopefully.

Anyway, if you haven’t, you gotta watch the movie yourself if you wanna get the full experience. Like, go grab some popcorn, put your feet up, and prepare to question your life choices. It’s wild.

int sleepingAmount = 0; // I swear I prob just need more sleep after this, lol.

So yeah, that's my two cents, or maybe twenty. What you've been up to, anything exciting or just the usual grind?
